3. Be in the moment.  Lose attachment to your ideas of how things should go.
4. Be brave to the point of stupidity.
5. What's wrong? Make a plan to fix it. You are not the voices in your head. Pay attention to who's talking and their agenda.
6. The soloverse: our reality is a mental model.

## Beliefs:

###The soloverse:

Shamelessley borrowing this beloved phrase from Buster Benson, though my interpretation is different.
1. *Whoops, you created the universe.* If you & I were in a room together with your grandma, chatting about favorite sexual positions, not one of us would have the same recollection of that event.  Not because of grandma, or my unbridled admiration of what you get up to in your spare time, but because everything that happens passes through our unique filters. In this narrow sense we each play a part in shaping our own reality.
2. *Whoops, you still created the universe.* You were born. You grew up and were taught all sorts of things and learned even more fumbling through it on your own.  But because you were helpless, you were pretty well corraled.  Then what happened? Did you end up in a cubicle, in line at the DMV, paying for your date's absurdly expensive chicken sandwich when *goddamnit* you don't even want to *be there* and *who comes up with these online dating algorithms anyway?*, still feeling helpless?  You are the single superheroic entity in the story of your life.  No one will come to fucking save you.  Save yourself.
3. *Oh yeah, and it's all your fault.*  All the shit you don't like about the world.  All the shit you don't like about yourself.  All the shit about everyone else. It's all your fault. Yup. Your filters interpreted the world the way you see it. If it bothers you so bad, go and fix it.  You have a lot more power to do so that you could even imagine.
